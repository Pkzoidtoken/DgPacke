### ðŸ”¥ Dargon Packer ðŸ”¥ 

### The DgPacker tool by Pkzoid is designed to package files and folders into a single archive, similar to popular tools like Zip or WinRAR. This tool enables users to conveniently "pack" multiple files or folders into one file, making organization and transfer simpler.

#### Here are some key points about DgPacker:

#### Compression Levels: 
Currently, DgPacker does not support any compression features. Adding options for different compression rates could be a future improvement.

#### Password Protection: 
There is currently no password protection available. Adding this functionality could help secure sensitive files in the future.

####  Cross-Platform Compatibility: 
DgPackerâ€™s packed files are designed to be used across different operating systems, including Linux and others, allowing flexibility for users on various platforms.

#### Python Integration: 
Packed files can be accessed directly via Python. Users can list contents with a printdir function, extract specific files, or extract all files, making it easy to integrate into Python-based workflows
