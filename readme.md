### This tool by Pkzoid allows you to package files and folders into a single archive, similar to Zip or WinRAR. The tool allows users to "pack" multiple files or folders into one file, simplifying the process of transferring and organizing information.

### This is what DgPacker does:

### Levels of compression:

Currently, DgPacker does not support compression. Future improvements could include options for different compression rates.

### Protection by password:

Password protection is not available at the moment. Future security measures could be improved by adding this functionality.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility:

DgPackerâ€™s packed files are designed to be used across different operating systems, including Linux and others, allowing flexibility for users on various platforms.

### Python Integration:

Packed files can be accessed directly via Python. Users can list contents with a printdir function, extract specific files, or extract all files, making it easy to integrate into Python-based workflows
